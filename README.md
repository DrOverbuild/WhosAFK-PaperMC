# WhosAFK-PaperMC
Simple AFK manager for the Paper MC server platform.

This plugin creates a new team on the main scoreboard called 'afkers'. Players are placed into that team when they go AFK.

Players can leave or enter AFK mode by using the `/afk` command.

Players go afk automatically after 60 seconds of inactivity. They automatically exit AFK mode if they move or chat.

While AFK, mobs do not target or damage players, nor do players loose hunger.

When the plugin is disabled, the 'afkers' team is removed from the main scoreboard.
